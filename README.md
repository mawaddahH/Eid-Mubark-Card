## Important Note on Download Functionality

Please be aware that the "Download" button functionality in the Eid Greeting Card Generator might encounter issues when the application is run locally on some personal devices. This is due to security restrictions in browsers that limit access to the local file system and certain features that are dependent on being served over a HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

### Potential Issues:

- **Browser Security Restrictions**: Modern browsers implement strict security measures to prevent malicious scripts from accessing or modifying files on the user's device without permission. Running the application locally (e.g., opening the `index.html` file directly in a browser) might not fully emulate the behavior of a web server, leading to limitations on certain functionalities, including downloading files.

- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Policies**: When running locally, CORS policies may block or restrict access to resources or APIs that are necessary for generating and downloading the card. This is less likely to be an issue when the application is hosted on a web server.

### Workarounds and Solutions:

- **Use a Local Development Server**: To mimic a more accurate production environment and bypass some of the limitations of running the application directly from the file system, consider using a local development server. Tools like `http-server` in Node.js, Python's built-in HTTP server (using `python -m http.server`), or live server features in code editors like Visual Studio Code can serve your project files over HTTP.

- **Deploy the Application**: For the best user experience, and to ensure all features work as intended, deploy the application to a web hosting service. There are several free and paid options available that can host static sites, including GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel.

### Further Assistance:

If you encounter any issues with the download functionality or any other aspect of the application, please feel free to open an issue in the GitHub repository. We welcome your feedback and contributions to improve the Eid Greeting Card Generator and ensure it works seamlessly for all users.
